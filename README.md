Due to the latest events regarding how GitHub treats user accounts from Russia, I'm expecting to be banned here with non-zero possibility, so in case it occurs, you can still find all repositories existing here on my GitLab page: https://gitlab.com/makise-homura.

Also feel free to contact me in any case related to my contributions (or anything else, actually):
* VK: https://vk.com/muzzdiez
* Discord: makise-homura#8793
* Telegram: @makise_homura

I am absolutely certain that no political or any other means may be a reason for discriminating anyone from contributing and participating in the FOSS community (it should be free of anything unrelated to collaborative development), but modern reality does not match my expectations. So there's a backup just in case it results in me being unable to use GitHub for contributing anymore.

Also, warrant canary notice: hereby I declare that at least until Apr 16, 2022, I never have been forced to publicly contend anything contrary to my beliefs to the time. If that happens, and it become prohibited for me to retract my declarations, this notice will be removed from here as quick as I can (and the fact of removal could be seen in commit log). Otherwise, this notice will be updated in no less than a year since last update (if it won't be updated, it shall be considered the same as if it is missing).
